# Other Useful Programs
 This houses all the created but not functionally important scripts
 
 A description of each program is as follows: 
 
 ## Spreadsheet
 
 This can take any CSV and automatically upload it to your personal drive. It can also take any spreadsheet in google and make it a csv file. It was thought it could be handy but it was too roundabout to actually use. 
 
 ## Unused_Functions 
 
 This houses functions that fit into class objects that were never used. Look at the file for their specific functions
 
 ## data_reader
 
 This is a script that takes a user list report from Google and searches it for a specific person. Printing success or failure depending if the person is there
 It requires a csv formated user list from google which report_generator can do. 
 
 
 ## Copy and Paste Function 
 
 This takes text that is typed and copies it into the clipboard. Works only for Windows but could easily be modified to fit linux and MAC
